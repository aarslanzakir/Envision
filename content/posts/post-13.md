After some provoking and aggressive aerial strikes at various cities of Pakistan by Indian military Pakistan air force responded fiercely with concrete accuracy and firmness by engaging and striking Indian jets including modern and state of the art French rafale in an aerial combat and by striking their airbases and strategic sites at ground in a limited scale  war last week.  


 This whole episode of conflict was observed monitored and dissected by international media.According to multiple news channels like CNN BBC and one Arab news channel the results of aerial combat were surprising and shocking. PAF demonstrated  exceptional and proficient fighting skills in a complex aerial combat with a much larger opponent. PAF maintained complete air superiority over its opponent throughout the context owning to it's better training expertise and  skills. The results of the conflict has brought a clear shift in geodynamics of the region. Pakistan armed forces especially PAF  has gained  a technical and psychological advantage over its counterpart. However after intervention of the United States president trump and resultant ceasefire the focus of the debate has shifted towards   measures promoting de escalation at borders between  two heavily armed neighbors. One can hope that sanity will prevail and collective wisdom of both the nations will give the peace process a chance by starting a series of dialogue to solve all their lingering disputes.


 The roots of political revelry and military hostility arise from disputed division  of territory and other resources  at the time of partition in 1947. hese disputes can be resolved and settled through dialogue and negotiations for betterment of large number of population of the region . If we trace down history one can see a rich civilization in subcontinent shared by population of neighbouring countries. We have numerous example of cooperation love and unity between Hindu Muslim communities before partition.The ongoing conflict and hatred is  sponsored and fueled by elites of the two countries and is  politically driven.  


The armed race between two underdeveloped nations has kept their populations deprived from basic amenities of life like health education clean water and food. It  is high time that leadership of both countries should focus on core issues of public and bring a paradigm shift  in political narratives. Political leadership media and academia of both the countries should work to reshape the narratives promoting peace harmony and love  so that people of subcontinent can grow and prosper themselves by benefiting from peace and harmony across both the nations.
