Apparently a limited scale war  is going on  between two neighbor nuclear powers which can escalate anytime into a large scale war with the potential to adversely affect the fate of the poor masses of both the countries. Conflict started by Indian aggression missile strikes and aerial intervention in  Pakistani territory and according  to local and international media Indian aerial aggression was retaliated and we'll reciprocated by Pakistan air force downing 5 Indian aircrafts. Apart from aerial combat there are news of heavy artillery fire exchange at various sectors of loc  between security forces of both the countries.  

With on going war hysteria  there is  so much influx of false information in media of both the sides along with adrenaline rush which is fueling and intensifying emotions at both sides of border. In the current scenario wisdom seems to go to backstage as truth is the first causality of the war. People from both the countries has forgotten that they are fighting poverty diseases and ignorance since decades and they are yet to secure the basic necessities of life  in their elite dominated states. As far as  the technical information is concerned   security officials  can be a better choice to get correct facts and figures but more importantly this elusive and dogmatic war scenario poses a direct challenge to collective wisdom  of masses of two nations whether  they will be able to avert war historic emotions for the peace prosperity and development of their future generations or they will be consumed by war propaganda machinery the time will tell.
