Terrorism has been on the boil in pakistan for the past 36 years because country has been suffering from a  acute  crisis of governance .People at large have been denied basic needs of life like education health care and housing .This has led people losing faith in the state.Such people readily embrace violent idealogies that promise a better life .

The governance crisis has resulted in declining public health,illiteracy and conditions conducive to poverty providing fertile ground for militants.Situation gets worson when weak state instituitions and state controlled corporations fail to provide speedy service delivery to public at large as law enforcement  agencies, administrative institutions and judiciary all have been politicized.Civil military conflict is also a major factor behind good governance crisis in pakistan.

## PAKISTAN

The path to violent extremism  for  youth is triggered by an identity crisis ,alienation from the state ,a struggle for recognition and resentment towards the state due to unemployement ,corruption and bad governance . Deeper penetration of internet and spread of modern social media application have accelerated the flow of communication and eroded state,s monopoly on information facilitating the spread of violent idealogies among masses .


In a country where people are deprived from basic human rights due to deepening crisis of good governance the enforcement of so called islamic laws during zia regime reinforced obscurantism in society discouraging any enlightened discourse .During afghan resistance war "jihadi" culture visibly damaged our nation,s social fabric .Islamic narrative was shifted towards militancy rather reforming society .This resulted in escalation of religion based violence .Freedome of expression was curtailed in the name of national interest leading to irrepairable damage to society .

Social marginalization , subservience ,vulnerability and violence is attributed to inequalities of market oppurtunities as in pakistan the non agricultural classes are often the poorest and the most exploited .
Social interventions such as equality of oppurtunity ,equal access to basic public service and inexpensive and prompt justice delivery can eradicate the root causes that give rise to repulsions finally leading to violence extremism and militancy .Good governance with participation of people can provide a sustainable solution of  terrorism in pakistan .
