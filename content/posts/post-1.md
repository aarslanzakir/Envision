Economic meltdown in Pakistan can best be correlated to three main factors. Tax evasions, subsidies and failed corporations. Brief description of each is given below.    
While most of the benefits of economic growth are shared by elite in a disproportionate manner its contribution in tax generating capacity of the country is negligible. Taxation is the essential instrument to promote equity and to finance priority investment needs of the state. In Pakistan however taxation remained adequate and regressive throughout seventy years since its birth.
The tax-GDP ratio of 14-15 percent is the lowest among countries of identical income levels. It is largely derived from indirect taxes affecting all income classes. Direct taxes account for only 2 to 3 percent of the GDP and its coverage extends to minimal population of country.
Autonomous tax payers account for a very small fraction of total tax collected. Excessive use of selective tax incentives discretionary exemptions from custom duties has deprived the state from much needed revenue and few individual entrepreneurs got substantial benefits at the expense of the state.
Subsidy is an important tool of the govt to promote welfare of the less privileged segment of society and under developed areas but unfortunately in Pakistan subsidies became a tool for accumulation of private wealth of ruling elite at the expense of a large segment of population.
The implicit and explicit losses of large state corporations like railway wade and steel mill by increasing budget deficit have put serious constraints on functional capacity of the governments to spend on public welfare along with reducing financial reserves of the country. For economic revival it is mandatory to expand the tax net abolishing all subsidies to elite along with privatizations of failed corporations
