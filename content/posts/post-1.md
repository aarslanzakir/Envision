In Pakistan state institutions are occupied mostly by privileged and powerful people who are beneficiary of elite centered system of governance. They have deliberately weakened the institutional infrastructure to a point where it is not able to function in larger public interest. Running private business and foreign investments require a business friendly environment and an administrative and legal set up free from unnecessary obstacles and hindrances for investors. Policy makers enact a complex myriad of  rules and regulations for business while interpretation of these rules and regulation is solely dependent on administrative machinery   which  is corrupt and cumbersome while  litigation process is slow and time consuming. All these factors contribute to create an unfavorable environment for general public to invest their capital in business. powerful elite present in legislative judicial and administrative institutions is the culprit  for all the economic turmoil country is passing through. Dismantling the elitest system of governance and  improving the  performance of state institutions so they can effectively serve in larger public interest can put an end to prevailing economic crisis uplifting the traumatized economy .
