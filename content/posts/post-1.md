After some provoking and aggressive aerial strikes at various cities of Pakistan by the Indian military, the Pakistan Air Force responded fiercely with concrete accuracy and firmness by engaging and striking Indian jets, including modern and state-of-the-art French Rafale, in an aerial combat. Additionally, the PAF struck their airbases and strategic sites on the ground in a limited scale war last week.


This whole episode of conflict was observed, monitored, and dissected by international media. According to multiple news channels like CNN, BBC, and one Arab news channel, the results of aerial combat were surprising and shocking. The PAF demonstrated exceptional and proficient fighting skills in a complex aerial combat with a much larger opponent. PAF maintained complete air superiority over its opponent throughout the context owing to its better training, expertise, and skills. The results of the conflict have brought a clear shift in the geodynamics of the region. Pakistan's armed forces, especially PAF, have gained a technical and psychological advantage over their counterpart. However, after the intervention of the United States President Trump and the resultant ceasefire, the focus of the debate has shifted towards measures promoting de-escalation at borders between two heavily armed neighbors. One can hope that sanity will prevail, and the collective wisdom of both nations will give the peace process a chance by starting a series of dialogues to solve all their lingering disputes.


The roots of political rivalry and military hostility arise from the disputed division of territory and other resources at the time of partition in 1947. These disputes can be resolved and settled through dialogue and negotiations for the betterment of a large number of people in the region. If we trace down history, one can see a rich civilization in the subcontinent shared by the populations of neighboring countries. We have numerous examples of cooperation, love, and unity between Hindu-Muslim communities before partition. The ongoing conflict and hatred are sponsored and fueled by elites of the two countries and are politically driven.


The arms race between two underdeveloped nations has kept their populations deprived of basic amenities of life, such as health, education, clean water, and food. It is high time that the leadership of both countries should focus on core issues of the public and bring a paradigm shift in political narratives. Political leadership, media, and academia of both countries should work to reshape the narratives promoting peace, harmony, and love so that the people of the subcontinent can grow and prosper by benefiting from peace and harmony across both nations.
